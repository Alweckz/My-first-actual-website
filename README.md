# My Trumpet Track Record
I started playing the trumpet in 4th grade. That was the earliest band was offered to us and I'm pretty it's like that for every school. If I rememember correctly, sometime probably during the beginning of the year, our school had a presentation or something four my grade about band that was presented by my band teacher. I don't really much about what he talked about but I think he just talked about each instrument. The reason I picked the trumpet was because he played it, and because of how versatile it was. He mentioned that it could play jazz, and some other genres that I forgot, that's besides the point. My elementary band teacher Mr. Hallback, my middle school and current high school teacher Mr. Clements, and his teacher assistant, or person that he's helping become a teacher Mr. Prata all play the trumpet.

# How I like the Trumpet
I just lost about the last hour minutes of progress from github crashing :( anyways I’ll have to redo. I actually quite enjoy playing the trumpet. As I said, I started in 4th grade, have plated it until my Sophomore year now (10th), and plan to keep going until my Senior year (12th). It was fun in elementary school being able to skip class for 30 minutes on Tuesday and Thurday to play badly with some friends. I’m pretty good at it now I would say <em> At least compared to the other trumpets in band LOL, </em> I like playing classical music because of how majest it sounds, especially on the trumpet. I also like finding pop songs transposed into trumpet sheet music and play them on my own, but unless the song is very popular, it’s unlikely that I’ll find good sheet music, if I find any sheet music at all. As of now, I’m learning how to play the trumpet solo in Haydn’s 3rd Movement Trumpet Concerto. It’as a very hard piece, but I’m probably going to know how to play it at the end of the year; it’s one of my current goals. It’s also in the show <em> Squid Game </em> Which I didn’t even know until finding the piece.

## Favorite Memories
One of my favorite memories is from elementary school. We had playing tests that we had to perform in front of the class every month or so. We would first get a card, and then get a colored circle sticker for each playing test we passed. I’m pretty sure every school did/does this because I’ve see a lot of people in band now with that card on their case. I have it on my old one but don’t have it on the new one I got for the trumpet I got in 8th grade. Anyways, when I was in 5th grade, I had 6th grade friends because the previous year, I was in a 4th/5th grade combo class. One of my friends Nissei had volunteered to do the playing exam. You can play as a solo, duet, trio, or quartet. He had picked me to play as his duo even though he knew that I didn’t think I was ready. The piece was <em> Musette </em> by Bach which was scary because it had the concert high C note which was the highest note we learned at the time. We were playing it fine, then when we got to the repeat sign, he couldn’t keep playing, so I was just doing a solo. I passed and got the sticker but he didn’t which was pretty funny. I think I got the blue sticker. I don’t have specific memories from 7th grade, but the entire year I had fun because I had a lot of friends in band. 8th grade was online so I actually don’t have many good memories of it. Freshman year was extremely fun because I had a lot of friends in band and we went to Disneyland in April. It was the first time I had ever went to Disney Land and it was some of the most fun I’ve ever had. Sophomore year doesn’t seem too promising though. A lot of my friends left band and I got the last trumpet chair because I forgot to turn in a playing exam which sucks because I’m a competitive person. I’ll have to keep practicing at home so my playing doesn’t decline. I already get easy trumpet parts and now we’re playing songs that are easy in general. I’ll just continue looking forward because I do enjoy playing the trumpet and I still have some friends left in band

I like playing trumpet and it’s fun. W conclusion.
