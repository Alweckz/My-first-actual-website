# My Trumpet Track Record
I started playing the trumpet in 4th grade. That was the earliest band was offered to us and I'm pretty it's like that for every school. If I rememember correctly, sometime probably during the beginning of the year, our school had a presentation or something four my grade about band that was presented by my band teacher. I don't really much about what he talked about but I think he just talked about each instrument. The reason I picked the trumpet was because he played it, and because of how versatile it was. He mentioned that it could play jazz, and some other genres that I forgot, that's besides the point. My elementary band teacher Mr. Hallback, my middle school and current high school teacher Mr. Clements, and his teacher assistant, or person that he's helping become a teacher Mr. Prata all play the trumpet.
